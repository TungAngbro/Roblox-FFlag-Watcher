This is a server/web app combo that watches for Roblox FFlag changes.

## Set-up guide

### Requirements
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Development

- `yarn start` to start development environment for the web app.
- `yarn server:dev` to start development environment for the server.

Run both of these in separate consoles to work with them in tandem.
